# ElectricHouseModel
For a project in my Physics science class, we are building an electric house model. I included an Arduino in mine and this is the code that controls it. 

# Ideas 
- Companion App (turn lights on/off, play sound, etc..)
- Christmas Light Show
- Working Smart Home System, uses same code as companion app just needs some voice modules. 
- Alexa Skill
